# Where's Waldo API

API used to access/update game data between the backend and the correlating frontend for my Where's Waldo project (https://github.com/caylinvu/wheres-waldo)

## Features

- Provides game and leaderboard data to the frontend website, which is used to play the game
- Game data is static
- New leaderboard entries can be created when a user has completed the game on the frontend

## Purpose

- To practice tying a frontend client to a backend server
- More practice with all frontend and backend concepts learned
